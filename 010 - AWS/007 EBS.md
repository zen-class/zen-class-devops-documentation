## Elastic Block Storage

**Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a block-level storage service provided by Amazon Web Services 
(AWS). It offers durable and scalable block storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances to 
provide persistent storage.

**Here are some key points about Amazon EBS:**

**1. Volume Types:** EBS provides different volume types to meet various performance and cost 
requirements:

**General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3):** Provides a balance of price and performance for a wide 
range of workloads.

**Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2):** Offers high-performance storage with customizable IOPS 
(Input/Output Operations Per Second) to meet demanding I/O requirements.

**Throughput Optimized HDD (st1):** Optimized for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive 
workloads, such as big data, data warehouses, and log processing.

**Cold HDD (sc1):** Designed for less frequently accessed workloads, offering low-cost storage 
for large volumes of data.

**1. Snapshots:** EBS allows you to create point-in-time snapshots of your volumes, which are 
stored in Amazon S3. These snapshots provide a backup of your data and can be used to 
create new volumes or restore existing ones.

2. EBS Volumes and EC2 Instances: EBS volumes are network-attached storage devices that can 
be attached to EC2 instances. You can attach and detach volumes from instances as needed, 
and volumes persist independently of the EC2 instance's lifecycle.
3. Elasticity and Scalability: EBS volumes can be resized dynamically without any disruption to 
your EC2 instances. You can increase the size or change the volume type of an existing 
volume to meet your storage needs.
4. Availability and Durability: EBS volumes are designed to be highly available and durable. They 
are replicated within an Availability Zone (AZ) to provide protection against component 
failures, and you can also enable cross-AZ replication for additional resilience.
5. Encryption: EBS volumes support encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service 
(KMS). You can encrypt both new and existing volumes to ensure data security.
6. EBS-Optimized Instances: Some EC2 instance types are EBS-optimized by default, which 
means they provide dedicated network capacity for EBS I/O. This helps to deliver consistent 
and high-performance storage access.
7. Use Cases: EBS is commonly used for a variety of workloads, including database storage, file 
systems, container storage, and boot volumes for EC2 instances.
It's important to note that EBS volumes are tied to a specific Availability Zone. If you need to use the 
same volume across multiple AZs, you can create an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) file system, 
which provides a scalable and shared file storage solution.
instance storage
Instance storage, also known as ephemeral storage, refers to the temporary block-level storage that 
is directly attached to an Amazon EC2 instance. It provides high-performance, low-latency storage 
that is ideal for certain types of workloads. Here are some key points about instance storage:
1. Physical Disks: Instance storage is typically comprised of physical disks that are physically 
attached to the host machine running the EC2 instance. These disks are not networkattached storage like Amazon EBS but are instead directly connected to the instance.
2. Performance: Instance storage offers excellent performance characteristics, including high 
IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and low latency. Since it is directly attached to 
the instance, there is minimal network overhead, allowing for fast read and write operations.
3. Temporary Storage: Instance storage is considered ephemeral or temporary storage because 
its data does not persist if the EC2 instance is stopped, terminated, or experiences an 
underlying hardware failure. When the instance is stopped or terminated, the data stored on 
the instance storage is lost.
4. Instance Store Volumes: Instance storage is presented to EC2 instances as instance store 
volumes. These volumes can be used as raw block devices or formatted with a file system. 
The available instance store volumes and their sizes vary depending on the EC2 instance 
type.
5. Use Cases: Instance storage is suitable for workloads that require high-performance, 
temporary storage, such as caching, temporary file storage, batch processing, and highperformance databases. It can be used to store frequently accessed data, intermediate 
results, or transient data that can be regenerated if lost.
6. Instance Store Metadata: Each EC2 instance with instance store volumes also has associated 
instance store metadata. This metadata provides information about the available instance 
store volumes and their mount points on the instance.
It's important to note that instance storage is not suitable for storing critical or persistent data. If 
data durability and persistence are required, it is recommended to use Amazon EBS volumes or other 
durable storage options provided by AWS.
Yes, both EBS (Elastic Block Store) and instance storage can be used like root volumes on 
Amazon EC2 instances. Each storage option has its own characteristics and use cases. Here 
are some key points:
 Root Volume: The root volume is the primary storage for EC2 instances, where the operating 
system and system files are stored. It is commonly configured as an EBS volume, but the 
choice of storage for the root volume depends on the EC2 instance types.
 EBS: EBS volumes provide durable and persistent block-level storage. They can be attached to 
EC2 instances and are suitable for storing data that needs to persist even when the instance 
is stopped or terminated. EBS volumes can be easily backed up, resized, and have various 
performance and durability options.
 Instance Storage: Instance storage, also known as ephemeral storage, is temporary blocklevel storage that is directly attached to the host machine running the EC2 instance. It offers 
high performance and low latency. However, the data stored on instance storage is lost if the 
instance is stopped or terminated, or if there is an underlying hardware failure.
 Use Cases: EBS volumes are commonly used for storing data that requires durability and 
persistence, such as application data, databases, and file systems. Instance storage is suitable 
for temporary storage needs, caching, temporary files, and workloads that can tolerate data 
loss or can regenerate data.
It's important to choose the appropriate storage option based on your specific requirements for data 
durability, persistence, performance, and cost.
EBS Backed EC2 INSTANCES -:
An "EBS-backed" EC2 instance refers to an Amazon EC2 instance that uses an Amazon EBS (Elastic 
Block Store) volume as its root volume. In this configuration, the root volume, which contains the 
operating system and system files, is stored on an EBS volume.
Here are some key points about EBS-backed EC2 instances:
1. Root Volume: The root volume is the primary storage for an EC2 instance and typically holds 
the operating system and boot files. In the case of an EBS-backed instance, the root volume 
is an EBS volume.
2. Durability and Persistence: EBS volumes are durable and persist even when the EC2 instance 
is stopped or terminated. This means that the data on the root volume remains intact, and 
you can start a new EC2 instance using the same EBS volume.
3. Snapshot and Backup: EBS-backed instances allow you to create snapshots of the EBS 
volumes, which provide a point-in-time backup of the data. These snapshots can be used to 
restore or create new EBS volumes, enabling data recovery and cloning of instances.
4. Flexible Volume Management: EBS volumes can be easily resized and modified without 
impacting the running EC2 instance. You can increase the size of the root volume, change its 
volume type, or attach additional EBS volumes as needed.
5. Instance Type Compatibility: Most EC2 instance types support EBS-backed instances. When 
launching an EC2 instance, you can select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is 
configured to use an EBS volume as the root device.
6. Performance and Availability: EBS-backed instances offer a reliable and scalable storage 
solution with configurable performance options. You can choose different EBS volume types 
based on your application's performance requirements.
EBS-backed instances are the recommended approach for most use cases, as they provide greater 
flexibility, durability, and ease of management compared to instance-store-backed instances.
